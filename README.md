CDK Patterns is intended to include a [repo](https://github.com/cdk-patterns/serverless) containing all of the official AWS Serverless architecture patterns built with CDK for developers to use.

Follow [@CdkPatterns](https://twitter.com/cdkpatterns) for live discussion / new pattern announcements. I plan to add a new pattern weekly so check back regularly!

You can also checkout [cdkpatterns.com](https://www.cdkpatterns.com) to see all patterns, filter by serverless component or see how they relate to the AWS Well Architected Framework

You can also check out our [Deconstructing CDKPatterns](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuR3jnWEnxx1G2axUMVaogg) YouTube channel for in depth walk throughs of the patterns.

Note, this is maintained by [@nideveloper](https://twitter.com/nideveloper) not AWS. For my motivation, please read this [blog post](https://www.mattcoulter.com/blog/post/2)
